Mix until dough is homogenized then take out and start kneading until dough passes the window pane test. I've been using King Arthur's all purpose flour which works & tastes great, however I'd consider using less olive oil than listed because there is a "slight smoky burnt/bitter" taste to the dough. I've let the dough chill up to a couple of days in the fridge before moving to the freezer in saran wrap and it results in an overall good thin crust. At this quantity, a single batch produces three dough balls, each for a ~16 inch pizza.`,
